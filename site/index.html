<p>My French Love is an immigrant novel pitting three young people displaced by the 30-year war in Sri Lanka, trying to make the most of what their shattered lives grudgingly offer in Europe. The love saga swinging between tragic and happily ever after taking a heartfelt look at love, family, and the consequences of choice. Vivid, heart-warming, and absorbing, the tale swings back and forth between France, England and Sri Lanka, pulling us deep into the lives of Malaka, Tharaka, Mali, and Camilia, who are as different as can be, and yet strongly similar. Malaka, a young man on a study visa, gets stranded in Paris and falls in love with an abandoned woman with two children surviving on government welfare to make ends meet. Into their midst comes Tharaka, a wealthy, eccentric daughter of a powerful government minister with a score to settle and loaded with unattainable dreams. Camilia, a footloose French opera teacher who longs to spend the rest of her life in the tropics, and the reluctant bride Lalitha, enliven the sweeping saga of bittersweet romance. The novel comes from Shamel Jayakody, a woman writer of seventeen novels, at the forefront of Sinhala literature.</p>
